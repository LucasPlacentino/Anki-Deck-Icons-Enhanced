## 101
This add-on allows you to add icons to your decks

1. On Anki, open the addon's files: go to `Tools` > `Add-ons` > `deck_icons` > `Show files`
2. On your files explorer, go to to the `user_files` folder
3. Add icons you'd like for your decks
     - They should be in the png format.
     - They should be named as the deck you want the icon for
4. If you don't add an icon, default.png will be used

## Examples

Here are some "deck name"-"icon name" pairing:

- "Language" and "language.png"
- "Language::English.png" and "English.png"
