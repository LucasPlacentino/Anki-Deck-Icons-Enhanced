# Anki Deck Icons Enhanced

This add-on allows you to add icons to your decks, up to a defined maximum sub-deck depth.

1. On Anki, open the add-on's config and set the max depth for decks to have an icon: go to `Tools` > `Add-ons` > `Deck Icons Enhanced` > **`Config`**
2. On Anki, open the addon's files: go to `Tools` > `Add-ons` > `Deck Icons Enhanced` > **`Show files`**
3. In your files explorer: go to to the **`user_files` folder**
4. Add icons you'd like for your decks
     - They should be in the **`png`** format.
     - **They should be named exactly as the deck you want the icon for but with these characters swapped with an _underscore `_`_** :  
          **`<`, `>`, `:`, `"`, `/`, `\`, `|`, `?`** (the list might not be exhaustive)
5. If you don't add an icon, `default.png` will be used (you can modify it to your liking as well)

## Examples

Here are some deck-name to icon-name pairing examples:

- "Language" and "`Language.png`"
- "First Year" and "`First Year.png`"
- "Language::English.png" and "`English.png`"
- "First Year::Second Semester::Calculus 1" and "`First Year_Second Semester_Calculus 1.png`"

**Your icons filename should be  exactly the deck name you want the icon for but with these characters swapped with an _underscore `_`_ :  
_`<`, `>`, `:`, `"`, `/`, `\`, `|`, `?`_ (the list might not be exhaustive)**
